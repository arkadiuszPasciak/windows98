# Windows98

My sandbox to improve my programming skills based on Windows 98 :)

Welcome to the Windows 98 project! This project aims to recreate the classic operating system, [Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98), using modern technologies. Windows 98 was a groundbreaking operating system that set the standard for personal computing in the late 90s.

However, with the advancement of technology, it has become obsolete and unsupported by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb). With this project, we seek to bring back the nostalgia and functionality of this classic operating system while using modern programming tools and techniques. My goal is to create a stable and functional operating system that can be most similiar to the original. This documentation aims to provide you with all the necessary information to use, contribute, and improve the Windows 98 project.

I hope that this project will bring back fond memories of using the original Windows 98 and inspire you to contribute to the development of this project.
