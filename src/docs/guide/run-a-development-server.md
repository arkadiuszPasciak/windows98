# Run a Development Server

## Steps

1. Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm run app:dev
```

This command will execute the dev script defined in your `package.json` file. Vite will start the development server and display the local URL in your terminal (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL displayed in your terminal. You should now see the project `running` in development mode.

3. As you make changes to your project files, the development server will `automatically reload` the browser, allowing you to see the updates in real-time.
