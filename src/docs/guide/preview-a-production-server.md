# Preview a Production Server

## Steps

1. [Build your project for production by running this command](/guide/building-for-production.html)

2. Start the production preview server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run app:preview
```

Vite will start a local server to preview the production build, and display the local URL in your terminal (usually [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)).

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL displayed in your terminal. You should now see your Vitest project's production build running on your local macOS machine.
