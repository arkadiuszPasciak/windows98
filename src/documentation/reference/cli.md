# Command Line Interface

## install

Command used in Node.js and JavaScript projects to install and manage dependencies specified in a project's `package.json file`. It retrieves the necessary packages from the npm registry and installs them locally in the project's `/node_modules` directory.

```bash
npm install
```

## prepare

Command used to install the Husky package in a Node.js project. Husky is a Git hook manager that allows you to run scripts and commands at specific points in the Git workflow, such as before committing or pushing changes. This command retrieves the Husky package from the npm registry and installs it as a dev dependency in the project's `/node_modules` directory

```bash
npm run prepare
```

## dev

Command used in a Vite project to start a local development server. Vite is a build tool that enables fast and efficient development of modern web applications. This command runs the `dev` script specified in the project's `package.json` file, which typically launches a local server at a specified port and watches for changes in the code to automatically reload the browser. This allows developers to rapidly iterate on their code and see the changes in real-time.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## build

Command used in a Vite project to create a production-ready build of the application. Vite is a build tool that enables fast and efficient development of modern web applications. This command runs the `build` script specified in the project's `package.json` file, which typically compiles and optimizes the code for production use, such as minifying files and removing unused code. The resulting files are output to a `/dist` directory, ready to be deployed to a production server.

```bash
npm run build
```

## preview

Command used in a Vite project to preview a production build locally before deploying it to a server. This command runs the `preview` script specified in the project's `package.json` file, which typically starts a local server to serve the production build files generated by running `npm run build`. This allows developers to ensure that the build is working correctly and catch any issues before deploying to a production server.

```bash
npm run preview
```

## typecheck

Command used in a Vue.js project that has been configured to use the TypeScript compiler (tsc) for type checking. This command runs the `typecheck` script specified in the project's `package.json` file, which typically invokes the TypeScript compiler to check the type annotations and type definitions in the project's TypeScript code. This helps to catch errors and improve the robustness of the code by ensuring that variables are used correctly and function parameters match the expected types.

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

## lint:js

Command used in a project that has been configured to use the ESLint tool for code linting. This command runs the script specified in the project's `package.json` file, which typically invokes ESLint to analyze the project's JavaScript code and identify any syntax or style errors. This helps to improve the consistency and readability of the code by enforcing a set of predefined rules or a custom configuration defined by the project team.

```bash
npm run lint:js
```
