## Github

### Description

Special directory used to store GitHub-specific configuration files and workflows. It helps organize and manage various GitHub features, such as issue and pull request templates, contributing guidelines, and GitHub Actions workflows. By centralizing these configurations in the `.github` folder, developers can maintain a clean and organized repository structure while leveraging GitHub's platform-specific features to enhance collaboration, automate tasks, and streamline the development process.

### Files

#### [Pull Request Template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)

`@/.github/pull_request_template.md`

GitHub-specific configuration file that provides a predefined structure and guidelines for creating new pull requests. By defining a template, maintainers can ensure that contributors follow a consistent format when submitting changes, making it easier to review and manage contributions. The template can include prompts for providing a description of the changes, relevant issue numbers, testing steps, and any additional information that might be required. When a contributor creates a new pull request, the content of the pull_request_template.md file will be automatically pre-filled in the description field, encouraging adherence to the established conventions and fostering a more efficient and organized collaboration process.
