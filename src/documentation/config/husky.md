# Husky

## Description

The directory in the application typically contains configuration files for the Husky Git hooks library. Husky allows developers to automate tasks, such as linting or testing, before committing changes to the repository. The `.husky` directory usually includes scripts that are executed automatically when certain Git hooks are triggered, such as pre-commit or pre-push. These scripts can help to improve code quality and maintain consistency within the codebase.

`@/.husky/*`

## Files

### Pre Commit

`@/.husky/pre-commit`

The file in the Husky Git hooks is a script that is executed automatically before committing changes to a repository. This file typically contains commands to run various tests, such as type checking, unit tests, and linting, to ensure that the code being committed meets certain standards.

In this specific example, the pre-commit script runs:

1. `npm run typecheck` command to perform type checking
2. `npm run test:run` to run unit tests
3. `npx lint-staged --no-stash` to run linting on staged files.

If any of these tests fail, the commit will be prevented and an error message will be displayed.

### Configuration Husky

`@/.husky/_/husky.sh`

The file in Husky Git hooks is a script that is used to set up the environment for the Git hooks. This file is typically included in the Git hooks directory and is sourced by the Git hook scripts to set up the necessary environment variables and functions. The `husky.sh` file is responsible for configuring Husky and ensuring that the necessary binaries and dependencies are installed before the Git hooks are executed. In essence, it serves as a bridge between the Husky library and the Git hooks scripts to ensure that everything is properly set up and configured.
