# Manual Installation

#### Requirements

[Node.js v18.12.0](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm 8.19.2](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed and setted on your system.

#### Steps

1. Ensure you have the required Node.js version installed. To check your current Node.js version, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
```

If you don't have the required version (18.12.0) or need to switch to it, you can use a Node.js version manager like nvm to manage multiple Node.js versions. You can find the installation guide for nvm at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arkadiuszPasciak/windows98.git
cd windows98
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the package.json file and installs the necessary dependencies, including Vite and other required packages.
