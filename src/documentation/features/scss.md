# [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

SCSS, also known as Sassy CSS, is a popular CSS preprocessor that extends the functionality of CSS, enabling developers to write more maintainable and structured stylesheets. SCSS introduces powerful features such as variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, allowing for the creation of reusable code snippets and the reduction of repetition in stylesheets. With its syntax that closely resembles CSS, SCSS is easy to learn and integrate into existing projects. SCSS files are compiled into standard CSS, ensuring compatibility with web browsers. By streamlining and enhancing the process of writing CSS, SCSS contributes to a more efficient and organized approach to styling web applications.
