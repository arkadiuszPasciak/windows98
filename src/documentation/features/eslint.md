# [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

ESLint is a widely-used, extensible static code analysis tool for JavaScript and TypeScript that helps developers identify and fix problematic patterns in their code. With a focus on maintaining code quality, consistency, and adherence to best practices, ESLint provides a large set of built-in rules, as well as the ability to create custom rules or use plugins for specific coding styles or frameworks. ESLint can be easily integrated into various development workflows, including IDEs, build systems, and version control hooks. By enforcing a consistent coding style and detecting potential issues early, ESLint contributes to a more efficient and maintainable development process for web applications.
