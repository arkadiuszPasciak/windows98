# [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

Husky is a popular tool for managing Git hooks in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, simplifying the process of adding and configuring hooks for various tasks such as code linting, testing, and formatting. By automating these tasks before commits or pushes, Husky helps to ensure code quality and consistency across a project. With an easy-to-use configuration and seamless integration with modern development workflows, Husky allows developers to catch potential issues early, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs or stylistic inconsistencies. By leveraging Husky git hooks, development teams can maintain a clean and reliable codebase, fostering a more efficient and collaborative development process.
