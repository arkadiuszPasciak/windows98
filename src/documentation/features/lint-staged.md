Lint-staged is a handy Node.js library designed to streamline the process of running linters, formatters, or other code quality tools on staged Git files. By only targeting the files that have been modified and staged for commit, lint-staged significantly reduces the time and resources required for these tasks, resulting in a faster and more efficient development workflow. With its simple configuration and compatibility with various code quality tools like ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier, lint-staged enables developers to catch and fix potential issues before they become part of the codebase, promoting a cleaner and more consistent code style across projects and teams.
