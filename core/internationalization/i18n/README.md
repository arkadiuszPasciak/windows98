# [@windows98/i18n]

## Description

In our application, we have implemented internationalization (i18n) to accommodate users who speak different languages and to provide a better user experience. To achieve this, we use the `vue-i18n` library plugin, which together enable seamless integration of multi-language support in our Vue.js application. Currently, we support English and Polish languages. We maintain separate translation files for each bundle, containing key-value pairs that map to specific user interface elements and messages. When a user selects their preferred language, the application dynamically updates the displayed text to match their choice

## Tools

### [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/)

Popular internationalization plugin for Vue.js applications. It allows us to manage translations, handle localization, and support language switching dynamically. With its easy-to-use API, we can efficiently organize and manage translations for our application's user interface elements, ensuring a smooth experience for users who prefer English or Polish.
