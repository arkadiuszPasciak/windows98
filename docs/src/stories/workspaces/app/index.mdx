<Title>@windows98/app</Title>

## Why?

The philosophy behind the `@windows98/app` package is centered around creating a main application that effectively utilizes other workspaces. This design allows for seamless transitions between different bundlers, such as switching from Vite to Webpack, without necessitating modifications to other workspaces of the repository.
