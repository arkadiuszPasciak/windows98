## Overview

The `@windows98/ci-cd` package provides a centralized CI/CD orchestration system for the Windows98 workspace. It serves as a command runner that executes build, lint, test, and deployment tasks across all workspace packages in a coordinated manner.

## Why?

The CI/CD workspace exists to solve several key challenges in monorepo management:

- **Centralized Command Execution**: Single entry point for running operations across multiple packages
- **Workspace Orchestration**: Ensures commands are executed in the correct packages based on the operation type
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub Actions and deployment pipelines
- **Development Efficiency**: Streamlined development workflows with consistent command execution
- **Error Handling**: Robust error reporting and command failure management
