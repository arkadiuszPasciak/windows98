<Title>ðŸ”§ Web API</Title>

The `@windows98/web-apis` workspace provides a curated set of browser Web APIs, wrapped and structured for easy, consistent use within the Windows98 monorepo. These APIs are designed to be injected and consumed primarily by micro-services, following the dependency injection and clean architecture patterns used throughout the project.

## Purpose

- **Centralizes** browser Web API access for all workspaces.
- **Encapsulates** only the APIs needed by the project (not a full polyfill or browser API mirror).
- **Promotes** testability and abstraction by providing injectable classes/services.
- **Ensures** consistent usage and error handling across the monorepo.

## Usage Philosophy

- Only add Web APIs that are actually needed by micro-services or other workspaces.
- Each API is exposed as a class or service, following the dependency injection pattern.
- APIs are documented and versioned as part of the monorepo.
