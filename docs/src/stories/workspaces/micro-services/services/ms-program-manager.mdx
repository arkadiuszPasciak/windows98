## Integration Example

```tsx
import { MSProgramManager } from '@windows98/micro-services'

const programManager = new MSProgramManager()

// Launch a program
const programId = programManager.launch('calculator', {
  windowMode: 'normal',
  startupParams: { theme: 'classic' }
})

// Monitor program state
programManager.onStateChange(programId, (state) => {
  console.log(`Program state changed: ${state}`)
})

// Manage program lifecycle
programManager.pause(programId)
programManager.resume(programId)
programManager.terminate(programId)
```
