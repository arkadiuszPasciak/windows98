<Title>🎮 MS App Controller</Title>

Application lifecycle and state management service for Windows98 ecosystem.

## What is MS App Controller?

MS App Controller is a core service responsible for managing the overall application lifecycle, state transitions, and control operations. It provides centralized control over application startup, shutdown, restart, and state management across the Windows98 environment.

## Key Features

### 🚀 **Application Lifecycle**
- Application startup and initialization
- Graceful shutdown and cleanup
- Application restart and recovery
- State persistence across sessions

### 🔄 **State Management**
- Global application state tracking
- State transition management
- State synchronization across components
- State restoration and recovery

### 🎛️ **Control Operations**
- System restart and shutdown controls
- Application pause and resume
- Emergency stop and recovery procedures
- Safe mode and diagnostic operations

### 🔧 **Initialization Control**
- Service initialization orchestration
- Dependency management and ordering
- Bootstrap sequence coordination
- Configuration loading and validation

### 📊 **Health Monitoring**
- Application health checks and monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Resource usage tracking
- System stability assessment

### 🛡️ **Error Recovery**
- Automatic error recovery mechanisms
- Fallback state management
- Safe failure handling
- Recovery strategy execution

### 🔗 **Integration Management**
- Service coordination and communication
- Inter-service dependency resolution
- Plugin and module lifecycle management
- External system integration control

### 📈 **Analytics & Logging**
- Application usage analytics
- Lifecycle event logging
- Performance monitoring and reporting
- Debugging and diagnostic information

## Integration Example

```tsx
import { MSAppController } from '@windows98/micro-services'

const appController = new MSAppController()

// Initialize application
await appController.initialize({
  services: ['theme', 'storage', 'config'],
  startupMode: 'normal',
  recoveryEnabled: true
})

// Control application state
appController.pause()
appController.resume()
appController.restart()

// Monitor application health
appController.onHealthChange((status) => {
  console.log(`Application health: ${status}`)
})

// Handle shutdown
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
  appController.shutdown()
})
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Application Management**: Controlling app startup, shutdown, and restart procedures
- **State Coordination**: Managing global application state and transitions
- **System Control**: Implementing system-wide control and management features
- **Error Recovery**: Handling application crashes and recovery scenarios
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking application health and performance metrics
- **Integration Control**: Coordinating service initialization and dependencies
