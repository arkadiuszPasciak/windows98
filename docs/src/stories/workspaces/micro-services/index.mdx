<Title>ðŸ”§ Micro Services</Title>

Understanding the micro-services architecture and available services in `@windows98/micro-services`.

## Overview

The `@windows98/micro-services` package provides a collection of independent, reusable services that handle core system functionality for the Windows98 ecosystem. Each micro-service is designed to be lightweight, focused, and easily integrable across different parts of the application.

## Why Micro Services?

### ðŸŽ¯ **Single Responsibility**
Each service handles one specific domain of functionality, making the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain.

### ðŸ”„ **Reusability**
Services can be used across multiple micro-frontends and applications without code duplication.

### ðŸ§ª **Testability**
Isolated services are easier to unit test and mock in integration tests.

### ðŸ“¦ **Modularity**
Services can be loaded independently, enabling better code splitting and performance optimization.

### ðŸ”§ **Maintainability**
Changes to one service don't affect others, reducing the risk of breaking changes.

## Available Services
