## Why?

The philosophy behind the `@windows98/micro-frontends` package is to provide a collection of independent, reusable UI components that represent Windows 98 applications. Each micro-frontend is a self-contained module with its own domain logic, UI components, and functionality, allowing for modular development and easy integration.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture** - Independent micro-frontends with isolated domain logic
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Each micro-frontend follows DDD principles with clear boundaries
- **React Integration** - Built with React and modern hooks for state management
- **TypeScript Support** - Full TypeScript coverage for type safety and better DX
- **Design System Integration** - Uses @windows98/design-system for consistent UI
- **Internationalization** - Built-in i18n support via @windows98/i18n
